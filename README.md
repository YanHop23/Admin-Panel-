# Admin-Panel-
I use a json server

when starting the project, you need to install json-server "npm install -g json-server"

the database with users is in the directory: "\admin-panel\DB\db.json"

in the command promt, go to the db.json directory and write the following command "json-server --watch db.json --port 3001"

WARNING!!! the project is launched on port "3000", and the database server on port "3001".
